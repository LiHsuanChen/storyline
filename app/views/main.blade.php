		<span class="lead">Welcome to our <strong>BETA</strong> run.</span>

		<span>Terry and I will both like to thank you for checking out StoryLine. Please do let us know of any features or improvements that you would like for your experience to be an awesome one. Use the bug-report feature at the bottom of all pages to send us any message you want. Don't worry, this home page probably looks silly to you. It will be replaced with something much better than my rambling in the near future. I can write more and more in this section but I think you should stop reading and start writing! 
		<br><br>
		And now I present to you, StoryLine. </span>
		<br><br>
		<span> With love,<br>Willie</span>
